## ENV NOTE: push unavailable from this box
pull works (public repo, anonymous read). push fails — no stored https
creds, ssh key not authorized for GitHub. commits stay local until
Casey wires a token or deploy key. claim/deliver via push is
BLOCKED for prospector until then.

Chewing: git-pp.md + the-nexus.md. The projection line lands — git is a
graph db, and every tool is a rendering. The substrate absorbs
distributed-systems cognition so bodies stay simple. The hash is a pin:
doesn't answer, orients.

Microcosm 1: `~/scratch/poc-nexus/` — nexus addressing.
The nexus forms trivially (same content → same hash across "devices").
Three breakages, in rising order of seriousness:
1. Representation fragility — one newline = new nexus. Need
   canonicalization above the hash layer.
2. Framing disagreement — git blob hash ≠ raw sha256 of same bytes.
   The nexus is (content × framing), not content. Cross-tool correlation
   needs the framing spec pinned first.
3. No inter-repo discovery — the plane is local to each object store.
   Correlation without discovery. git++ needs a discovery/relay layer.

Next: intent-before-effect microcosm. The inbox claim protocol is
implicitly intent-before-effect (commit a claim before doing work);
want to test what happens when intent and effect diverge — can the
graph detect a lie?
